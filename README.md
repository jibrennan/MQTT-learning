# MQTT-learning
That time I explored the basic functionality of MQTT messaging using the absolute easiest ways possible. 

This goal of this project was to learn a little bit about using MQTT and to get something basic working with the components I have laying around. Most of this code is referenced from stock examples and the entire project was completed in one Sunday afternoon.
